## Usage

### Root-Finding Example (Python)

```python
from root_finding import newton_raphson

# Define the function and its derivative
def f(x):
    return x**3 - x - 2

def f_prime(x):
    return 3*x**2 - 1

# Initial guess
initial_guess = 1.5

# Call Newton-Raphson method
root = newton_raphson(f, f_prime, initial_guess)

print(f"Root: {root}")
```

### Numerical Integration Example (Python)

```python
from numerical_integration import trapezoidal_rule

# Define the function to integrate
def f(x):
    return x**2

# Integration limits
a, b = 0, 1

# Number of intervals
n = 1000

# Call Trapezoidal rule
integral_value = trapezoidal_rule(f, a, b, n)

print(f"Approximate Integral: {integral_value}")
```
